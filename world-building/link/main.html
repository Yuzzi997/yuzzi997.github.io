        It was a shock to

:04:23.	:04:27.
me that at the time, the Kennel Club saw nothing wrong in mother to

:04:27.	:04:33.
son, father to daughter and sister to brother matings. And seemed

:04:33.	:04:36.
oblivious to the scientific evidence that such close in-

:04:36.	:04:41.
breeding was a problem. You could say we will no longer register

:04:41.	:04:45.
mother son ratings because it's a level of breeding that's

:04:45.	:04:49.
unacceptable. Yes, we could. And if that is the right thing to do, we

:04:49.	:04:54.
ought to do it. I mean... there's a scientific basis that

:04:54.	:04:57.
says that's going to produce healthier, long lived animals that

:04:57.	:05:02.
make good pets, of course, we would go along with it. Why don't you

:05:02.	:05:06.
know that. It's the basic principles of breeding: It depends

:05:06.	:05:10.
on the mother son. If they're the last two. Have you got children?

:05:10.	:05:15.
Have you got a daughter? Yes. you have a baby with her? Of course

:05:15.	:05:20.
not. That's an entirely different issue. From the Toy Group the

:05:20.	:05:26.

Despite

:07:21.	:07:24.
the Kennel Club's initial insistence there was little wrong,

:07:24.	:07:29.
two months after the programme, it committed to a review of every

:07:29.	:07:33.
breed standard, removing clauses in them that could lead to the

:07:33.	:07:36.
disturbing physical extremes we documented. A couple of months

:07:36.	:07:40.
after that, it announced a ban on parent to offspring and brother to

:07:40.	:07:47.
sister matings. Other measures followed, as we will see.
