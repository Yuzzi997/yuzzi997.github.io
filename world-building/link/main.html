            It was a shock to

            me that at the time, the Kennel Club saw nothing wrong in mother to
        
           
            son, father to daughter and sister to brother matings. And seeme
        
            
            oblivious to the scientific evidence that such close in-
        
           
            breeding was a problem. You could say we will no longer register
        
           
            mother son ratings because it's a level of breeding that's<br />
        
            
            unacceptable. Yes, we could. And if that is the right thing to do, we<br />
        
           
            ought to do it. I mean... there's a scientific basis that<br />
        
          
            says that's going to produce healthier, long lived animals that<br />
        
           
            make good pets, of course, we would go along with it. Why don't you<br />
        
           
            know that. It's the basic principles of breeding: It depends<br />
        
            
            on the mother son. If they're the last two. Have you got children?<br />
        
            
            Have you got a daughter? Yes. you have a baby with her? Of course<br />
        
            
            not. That's an entirely different issue. <br />
