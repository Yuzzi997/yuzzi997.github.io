    It was a shock to<br />

    :04:23.	:04:27.<br />
    me that at the time, the Kennel Club saw nothing wrong in mother to<br />

    :04:27.	:04:33.<br />
    son, father to daughter and sister to brother matings. And seemed<br />

    :04:33.	:04:36.<br />
    oblivious to the scientific evidence that such close in-<br />

    :04:36.	:04:41.<br />
    breeding was a problem. You could say we will no longer register<br />

    :04:41.	:04:45.<br />
    mother son ratings because it's a level of breeding that's<br />

    :04:45.	:04:49.<br />
    unacceptable. Yes, we could. And if that is the right thing to do, we<br />

    :04:49.	:04:54.<br />
    ought to do it. I mean... there's a scientific basis that<br />

    :04:54.	:04:57.<br />
    says that's going to produce healthier, long lived animals that<br />

    :04:57.	:05:02.<br />
    make good pets, of course, we would go along with it. Why don't you<br />

    :05:02.	:05:06.<br />
    know that. It's the basic principles of breeding: It depends<br />

    :05:06.	:05:10.<br />
    on the mother son. If they're the last two. Have you got children?<br />

    :05:10.	:05:15.<br />
    Have you got a daughter? Yes. you have a baby with her? Of course<br />

    :05:15.	:05:20.<br />
    not. That's an entirely different issue. From the Toy Group the<br />

        What I see in front of me is a parade of mutants,<br />

        :05:45.	:05:50.<br />
        it's a freakish, garish beauty pageant that has nothing to do with<br />
        
        :05:50.	:05:58.<br />
        health and welfare. The show world is about an obsession, about beauty.<br />
        
        :05:58.	:06:03.<br />
        There is a ridiculous concept that is how we should judge dogs. Best<br />

        :06:07.	:06:11.<br />
        written on a piece of paper as what you should look like. Takes no<br />
        
        :06:11.	:06:14.<br />
        account of your temperament, your fitness for purpose as a pet animal<br />
        
        :06:14.	:06:21.<br />
        and that, to me, makes absolutely no sense at all.
        :06:21.	:06:26.<br />
        
        
        We also discovered<br />
        
        :06:21.	:06:26.<br />
        that there were dire consequences for some puppies that didn't meet<br />
        
        :06:26.	:06:31.<br />
        the stringent standards. One breeder of row deezian ridge backs<br />
        
        :06:31.	:06:35.<br />
        referring openly to the culling of puppies born without the trade mark<br />
        
        :06:35.	:06:41.<br />
        ridge. We do have trouble nowadays with the young vets who tend to see<br />
        
        :06:41.	:06:45.<br />
        everything in black and white and won't put them down. It's a healthy,<br />
        
        :06:45.	:06:48.<br />
        beautiful puppy, there's nothing wrong with it except it hasn't a<br />
        
        :06:48.	:06:53.<br />
        ridge. You say well, they're meant to have ridges. It's not easy.<br />
        
        :06:53.	:06:57.<br />
        Usually we end up having to go to an old vet that we've known for<br />
        
        :06:57.	:07:01.<br />
        years just to quietly put them sleep. I would rather they were put<br />
        
        :07:01.	:07:04.<br />
        down under my care than they landed in the hands of the fighting people,<br />
