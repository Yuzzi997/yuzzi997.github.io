    It was a shock to<br />

    :04:23.	:04:27.<br />
    me that at the time, the Kennel Club saw nothing wrong in mother to<br />

    :04:27.	:04:33.<br />
    son, father to daughter and sister to brother matings. And seemed<br />

    :04:33.	:04:36.<br />
    oblivious to the scientific evidence that such close in-<br />

    :04:36.	:04:41.<br />
    breeding was a problem. You could say we will no longer register<br />

    :04:41.	:04:45.<br />
    mother son ratings because it's a level of breeding that's<br />

    :04:45.	:04:49.<br />
    unacceptable. Yes, we could. And if that is the right thing to do, we<br />

    :04:49.	:04:54.<br />
    ought to do it. I mean... there's a scientific basis that<br />

    :04:54.	:04:57.<br />
    says that's going to produce healthier, long lived animals that<br />

    :04:57.	:05:02.<br />
    make good pets, of course, we would go along with it. Why don't you<br />

    :05:02.	:05:06.<br />
    know that. It's the basic principles of breeding: It depends<br />

    :05:06.	:05:10.<br />
    on the mother son. If they're the last two. Have you got children?<br />

    :05:10.	:05:15.<br />
    Have you got a daughter? Yes. you have a baby with her? Of course<br />

    :05:15.	:05:20.<br />
    not. That's an entirely different issue. From the Toy Group the<br />

    Despite<br />

    :07:21.	:07:24.<br />
    the Kennel Club's initial insistence there was little wrong,<br />

    :07:24.	:07:29.<br />
    two months after the programme, it committed to a review of every<br />

    :07:29.	:07:33.<br />
    breed standard, removing clauses in them that could lead to the<br />

    :07:33.	:07:36.<br />
    disturbing physical extremes we documented. A couple of months<br />

    :07:36.	:07:40.<br />
    after that, it announced a ban on parent to offspring and brother to<br />

    :07:40.	:07:47.<br />
    sister matings. Other measures followed, as we will see. <br />

        :06:41.	:06:45.<br />
        everything in black and white and won't put them down. It's a healthy,<br />
        
        :06:45.	:06:48.<br />
        beautiful puppy, there's nothing wrong with it except it hasn't a<br />

        :06:53.	:06:57.<br />
        Usually we end up having to go to an old vet that we've known for<br />

        years just to quietly put them sleep. I would rather they were put<br />

            She was screaming because she opened her mouth really wide and<br />
            
            :25:12.	:25:19.<br />
            just nothing. It was awful. This is Pie shortly before she was put to<br />
            
            :25:19.	:25:24.<br />
            sleep. She'd lost a third of her body weight. She was just two years<br />
            
            :25:24.	:25:32.<br />
            old. It looked like an unlucky one off.<br />

            The pedigree information<br />

            doctor Cattanach examined suggested strongly that juvenile kidney<br />
            
            :28:12.	:28:18.<br />
            disease in boxers is a recessive condition. Puppies are at risk only<br />
            
            :28:18.	:28:22.<br />
            if both parents carry the faulty gene. And the closer the in-<br />
            
            :28:22.	:28:26.<br />
            breeding, the higher the risk of something like this coming out. In<br />
            
            :28:26.	:28:32.<br />
            this case, one saw pretty well extreme, the closest possible<br />
            
            :28:32.	:28:38.<br />
            inbreeding really. Roxie's pedigree reveals that Gucci is both her<br />
            
            :28:38.	:28:43.<br />
            father and on her mother's side also her grandfather. Gucci was<br />
            
            :28:43.	:28:53.<br />
            mated to his own daughter from a previous litter to produce Roxie.<br />
            
            :28:53.	:29:00.<br />
            This was before the ban in 2009. Dr Cattanach quickly found over 30<br />
            
            :29:00.	:29:05.<br />
            cases of young boxers that had been diagnosed with juvenile kidney<br />
            
            :29:05.	:29:10.<br />
            disease between 2007 and 2010, most now dead and all closely related.<br />
            
            :29:10.	:29:15.<br />
            He thought the likelihood of this happening by chance was remote. In<br />
            
            :29:15.	:29:19.<br />
            almost half of the cases, Gucci is either the puppy's father or<br />
            
            :29:19.	:29:23.<br />
            grandfather. That was, to me, very worrying<br />
            
            :29:23.	:29:30.<br />
            because this dog had been used so many times as stud. It meant the<br />
            
            :29:31.	:29:35.<br />
            gene was possible, it could be all over the country. If it's proven<br />
            
            :29:35.	:29:38.<br />
            that an inherited gene is responsible, it would be more than<br />
            
            :29:38.	:29:44.<br />
            worrying. Gucci is owned by one of the most powerful people in the<br />

            :30:11.	:30:14.<br />
            November 2010, doctor Cattanach wrote to Janice Mair to tell her<br />
            
            :30:14.	:30:19.<br />
            that he thought Gucci might be carrying a deadly gene. I thought<br />
            
            :30:19.	:30:26.<br />
            she would be the best person to help out and you know lead the way,<br />
            
            :30:26.	:30:30.<br />
            away. But she didn't believe it. Worse was to come. <br />
            
            :30:30.	:30:36.<br />
            This really did hit right to<br />
            
            :30:44.	:30:51.<br />
            the heart of the current boxer, show boxer population. Dr Cattanach<br />
            
            :30:51.	:30:56.<br />
            concluded that if Gucci does carry a faulty gene, it's most likely he<br />
            
            :30:56.	:31:02.<br />
            inherited it through dogs from another famous kennel, Walkon<br />
            
            :31:02.	:31:09.<br />
            Boxers run by Yvonne Miller and her veterinary surgeon husband Walker<br />
            
            :31:09.	:31:16.<br />
            Miller. There is a champion walkon dog in all but 30 cases that have<br />
            
            :31:16.	:31:21.<br />
            been identified so far. Other walkon dogs have produced puppies<br />
            
            :31:21.	:31:26.<br />
            with juvenile kidney disease. There was no difintive proof that<br />
            
            :31:26.	:31:31.<br />
            Dr Cattanach was right. What was needed as a gene test to identify<br />
            
            :31:31.	:31:34.<br />
            dogs that appear to be perfectly healthy, but were silently carrying<br />
            
            :31:34.	:31:38.<br />
            the condition and for that, Dr Cattanach needed blood samples from<br />
            
            :31:39.	:31:45.<br />
            as many boxers as possible. In February 2011, at a meeting of<br />
            
            :31:45.	:31:50.<br />
            the boxer breed Council held at this hotel in Warwickshire, Dr<br />
            
            :31:50.	:31:56.<br />
            Cattanach presented his findings to, among others, Janice Mair and<br />
            
            :31:56.	:32:04.<br />
            Walker Miller. What was the reaction? Silence almost.<br />
            
            :32:04.	:32:08.<br />
            Cattanach appeared to have been heard. After the meeting, the breed<br />
            
            :32:08.	:32:11.<br />
            council issued a press release that recognised the seriousness of the<br />
            
            :32:11.	:32:16.<br />
            situation and it made several recommendations. It offered Dr<br />
            
            :32:16.	:32:19.<br />
            Cattanach the full support of the breed Council in his efforts to<br />
            
            :32:19.	:32:26.<br />
            find a genetic test for juvenile kidney disease. It encouraged boxer<br />
            
            :32:26.	:32:30.<br />
            owners to donate blood to help with the research, including those who<br />
            
            :32:30.	:32:36.<br />
            owned the parents of affected dogs. And it advised breeders to avoid<br />
            
            :32:36.	:32:40.<br />
            in-breeding to minimise the chances of a puppy inheriting two cop yids<br />
            
            :32:40.	:32:47.<br />
            of the faulty gene. <br />
            
            :32:47.	:32:51.<br />
            
            The<br />
            
            :32:57.	:33:02.<br />
            problem is how you deal with them when you find it. This is where<br />
            
            :33:02.	:33:09.<br />
            it's gone badly wrong here. A year on from the meeting, the boxer<br />
            
            :33:09.	:33:14.<br />
            breed Council website contains no information or advice on the threat<br />
            
            :33:14.	:33:19.<br />
            from juvenile kidney disease. While some owners and breeders have<br />
            
            :33:19.	:33:25.<br />
            provided blood samples for the DNA research, Walkon Boxers have not,<br />
            
            :33:25.	:33:27.<br />
            despite Walker Miller being on the health committee and being a vet<br />
            
            :33:27.	:33:35.<br />
            himself. In a statement, contested by Dr Cattanach, Yvonne Miller<br />
            
            :33:35.	:33:40.<br />
            insists that she offered blood samples for the DNA research which<br />
            
            :33:40.	:33:45.<br />
            she says were dismissed of being of no interest.<br />
            
            :33:45.	:33:51.<br />
            In addition, no blood samples have yet been provided by Janice Mair of<br />
            
            :33:51.	:33:55.<br />
            Glenauld Boxers. You know, she believed, genuinely believes that<br />
            
            :33:55.	:34:03.<br />
            her dog is not implicated in any way, then why not give blood? Why<br />
            
            :34:03.	:34:06.<br />
            not help? In a statement, Janice Mair says that she would be willing<br />
            
            :34:07.	:34:11.<br />
            to give a sample from Gucci, but understood that Dr Cattanach had<br />
            
            :34:11.	:34:15.<br />
            already obtained a sufficient number of samples. She also states<br />
            
            :34:15.	:34:19.<br />
            that to date, there have been no cases involving dogs living in our<br />
            
            :34:19.	:34:25.<br />
            own kennel and the research initially focused on affected dogs.<br />
            
            :34:25.	:34:29.<br />
            Notwithstanding the bomber breed Council's advice to avoid close<br />
            
            :34:29.	:34:35.<br />
            inbreeding, both Glenn auld and Walkon Boxers have registered<br />
            
            :34:35.	:34:39.<br />
            litters in the past year much more inbreed than the average boxer.<br />
            
            :34:39.	:34:44.<br />
            Both kennels have mated dogs that an independent geneticist says<br />
            
            :34:44.	:34:49.<br />
            could be cariers of juvenile kidney disease, unwittingly, perhaps,<br />
            
            :34:49.	:34:51.<br />
            putting puppies at risk of the condition. Janice Mair says that<br />
            
            :34:51.	:34:55.<br />
            she has followed advice to avoid mating possible carriers with close<br />
            
            :34:55.	:35:03.<br />
            relatives. Yvonne Miller says she would never breed from dogs she has<br />
            
            :35:03.	:35:08.<br />
            reason to believe was spreading juvenile kidney disease.<br />
            
            :35:08.	:35:12.<br />
            Both breeders say they take genetic diversity into account when<br />
            
            :35:12.	:35:16.<br />
            breeding and that the health and welfare of their dogs is and always<br />
            
            :35:16.	:35:22.<br />
            has been of paramount importance. They should have seen this, they<br />
            
            :35:22.	:35:27.<br />
            would have seen it, they may have seen it, but they have not<br />
            
            :35:27.	:35:31.<br />
            recognised it, understand it and done something about it.<br />

            come forward, more blood samples and more people willing to stand up<br />

            a -- for the health of their breed. This has got to stop. This has to<br />
            
            :35:58.	:36:07.<br />
            stop. People come to us to buy dogs in good faith. They buy a pet<br />

            breed dogs, knowing they're going to die. You don't do that. You know,<br />
            
            :36:15.	:36:22.<br />
            this breed is at risk. I have decided to speak out because,<br />

            knowing what I know, and to, you know, I feel as if I have a duty<br />
            
            :36:28.	:36:33.<br />
            and responsibility to those people that bought puppies from me. I mean<br />

            Inbreeding and the prolific use of popular stud dogs is an issue that
            
            :37:03.	:37:09.
            reaches far beyond boxers. Both practices have contributed to a
            
            :37:09.	:37:13.
            loss of genetic diversity that is a serious threat to the long-term
            
            :37:13.	:37:17.
            survival of many breeds, as top geneticist Steve Jones warned us
            
            :37:17.	:37:20.
            three years ago. If the dog breeders insist on going further
            
            :37:20.	:37:25.
            down that road, I can say with confidence really that there is a
            
            :37:25.	:37:30.
            universe of suffering waiting for many of these breeds and many, if
            
            :37:30.	:37:34.
            not most of these breeds, will not survive. They will be so inbred,
            
            :37:35.	:37:39.
            they will not be able to reproduce and their genes will come to a dead
