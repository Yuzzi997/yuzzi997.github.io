        The Kennel Club saw nothing wrong in mother to<br />
        
        <div class="time">:04:27. :04:33.<br /></div>
       
        son, father to daughter and sister to brother matings. And seemed<br />

        <div class="time">:04:33. :04:36.<br /></div>
       
        oblivious to the scientific evidence that such close<br />

        <div class="time">:04:36. :04:41.<br /></div>

        in-breeding was a problem. You could say we will no longer register<br />

        <div class="time">:04:41. :04:45.<br /></div>

        mother son ratings because it's a level of breeding that's<br />

        <div class="time">:04:45. :04:49.<br /></div>

        unacceptable.<br />

            Three weeks after our program was broadcast,<br />
            :07:11. :07:17.<br />
            the Kennel Club announced a new code of ethics that explicitly<br />
            :07:17. :07:21.<br />
            forbids breeders to cull puppies on purely cosmetic grounds.<br />
            :07:21. :07:24.<br />

        <div>
            We were tipped off that the<br />
            :11:11. :11:14.<br />
            winning dog at this championship show had been diagnosed with<br />
            :11:14. :11:21.<br />
            syringomyelia. There are no rules to stop anyone showing a dog with<br />
            :11:21. :11:26.<br />
            an inherited disease, but it was an uncomfortable moment for owner<br />

            New research now suggests that by the age of six up to 70% of<br />
            :16:42. :16:49.<br />
            the breed could have the condition. Not all show obvious symptoms, but<br />
            :16:49. :16:55.<br />
            that doesn't always prevent their pup yids being severely affected.<br />
            :16:55. :16:59.<br />
            The chances of having a dog that will develop<br />
            :17:27. :17:32.<br />
            height ral valve disease and/or syringomyelia is too high.<br />

            Dogs breeds are<br />
        :22:38. :22:41.<br />
        man made. If you make a breed healthier, you take it to the<br />
        :22:41. :22:51.<br />
        future. It's a beautiful animal. It can be beautiful on the inside.<br />

            They will be so inbred,<br />
            :37:35. :37:39.<br />
            they will not be able to reproduce and their genes will come to a dead<br />

            A father daughter mating for example would<br />
            :39:32. :39:37.<br />
            produce puppies with a COI of 25%. That's now banned, so how come the<br />
            :39:38. :39:43.<br />
            Kennel Club registers dog was higher COI's than this? This Cesky<br />
            :39:43. :39:50.<br />
            Terrier has a co-efficient of 45.7%. It happens because inbreeding is<br />
            :39:50. :39:53.<br />
            cumulative and dog breeders have been keeping it in the family for<br />
            :39:53. :39:57.<br />
            decades. You can reduce the damage by saying, OK, you can't mate with<br />
            :39:57. :40:01.<br />
            your daughter or brothers and sisters, but actually, if you're<br />
            :40:01. :40:05.<br />
            mating with your cousins, that is almost as bad F that goes on for a<br />
            :40:05. :40:12.<br />
            long time, that just builds up. all breeds are this inbred. Some<br />
            :40:12. :40:17.<br />
            breeders go to considerable lengths to make the most of the available<br />
            :40:17. :40:20.<br />
            genetic diversity in their breeds. While the Kennel Club allows this<br />
            :40:20. :40:23.<br />
            degree of inbreeding, dogs will suffer.<br />

            This is what 100 years of the show ring has done to the dachshund,<br />

            :41:58. :42:04.<br />
            today's dogs have much shorter legs. The original bull terrier on the<br />

            :42:05. :42:09.<br />
            left had a normal shaped head, markedly different to today's dog<br />

            :42:09. :42:13.<br />
            on the right. And then, there's the bulldog. The subject of fierce<br />

            :42:13. :42:19.<br />
            debate. Bull dogs were once used for bull baiting. And breeders are<br />

            :42:19. :42:24.<br />
            fond of explaining that the skin folds on the dog's face are there<br />

            :42:24. :42:30.<br />
            to channel the bulls blood from the dogs' eyes and that the shape of<br />

            :42:30. :42:34.<br />
            the head would allow it to breathe while allowing it to hang onto a<br />

            :42:34. :42:39.<br />
            bull's nose. Today's bulldog looks nothing like the dog in the baiting<br />

            :42:39. :42:42.<br />
            rings of old. Here's what we've done to the breed in less than 100<br />

            :42:42. :42:52.<br />

            In fact, our national dog has been disordered into such an unnatural<br />

            :42:56. :43:01.<br />
            shape that the breed often needs assistance to mate and Caesarean<br />
    
            :43:01. :43:10.<br />
            sections to give birth (. We've become completely and utterly<br />
    
            :43:10. :43:14.<br />
            desense tiesed to the fact that breeding these mutants, these<br />
    
            :43:14. :43:19.<br />
            deformed, disabled, disease prone animals is either shocking or<br />
    
            :43:19. :43:24.<br />
            abnormal. It's not normal. <br />
    
            :43:24. :43:29.<br />
        </div>

        <div>
            Same with the original Chinese shar pei, completely free<br />

        :46:46. :46:49.<br />
        of the wrinkling that often burdens the Westernised version of the<br />

        :46:49. :46:54.<br />
        breed. Then there is this working Neapolitan mastiff, a revelation<br />

        :46:54. :47:01.<br />
        compared to this winning show dog. I think trying to tinker with<br />

        :47:01. :47:05.<br />
        beauty pageants to somehow make them better is simply the canine<br />

        :47:05. :47:09.<br />
        equivalent of trying to polish a turd. It simply isn't going to<br />

        :47:09. :47:13.<br />
        happen.<br />

        :47:13. :47:20.<br />

        <div>
            Some pugs do this because their airways block when they drop their<br />

            :51:26. :51:30.<br />
            heads. But like many pugs, Cissy's<br />
    
            :51:30. :51:35.<br />
            problems are much more than just blocked airways. Her tongue is too<br />
    
            :51:35. :51:40.<br />
            big for her mouth. Her eye sockets are so shallow that under stress<br />
    
            :51:40. :51:43.<br />
            her eyes could pop out and she still has the same number of teeth<br />
    
            :51:43. :51:48.<br />
            as a normal dog, but no room for them to grow properly.<br />
    
            :51:48. :51:55.<br />
            
            Inbreeding for a flat face, we've robbed them of the<br />
    
            :52:46. :52:55.<br />
            ability to cool themselves. Cissy cannot get back her lost nose,<br />
    
            :52:55. :52:59.<br />
            but he can remove some of the excess tissue blocking her airways.<br />
