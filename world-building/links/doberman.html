    <h1>German Doberman pinscher</h1>
    <h3>
        “What is the difference between a taxidermist and a tax assessor?” Mark Twain once asked, before answering with his customary wryness: “The taxidermist takes only your skin.”
    <div>
        In our polarized times, in which once-incontrovertible facts have become matters of opinion, one certainty remains: Nobody likes to pay taxes. And while today we pay the piper with electronic transfers or, less and less, paper checks by mail, a century ago that unpleasant task fell to the tax collector.
    </div>

    <div>
        Not surprisingly, as they made their rounds, tax collectors worried about their personal safety: They were not only at risk of blows from angry constituents who disputed their assessments or just plain didn't want to hand over any part of their income, but they were also tempting targets for criminals all too eager to separate them from their hard-won tithes.
    </div>


        <p>
            Though demanding work, tax collecting often was not a full-time job, particularly in smaller cities and villages. As a result, many tax collectors maintained other livelihoods as well.

    <div>
        That was the case with a certain late-19th-Century entrepreneur from Apolda, Germany, who also was a night watchman, dog catcher, and - shades of that Twain quote - flayer, or skinner, of dogs. Brilliantly cross-pollinating his customs and canine careers, Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann created the breed that today bears his name, the Doberman Pinscher.

        Dobermann]s Famous Guard Dog
        Surveying the dogs in his pound, Dobermann selected the strongest, steeliest, and most intelligent to help with his tax collecting. The importance of an unflappable temperament for this perilous work could not be overstated.
    </div>

    <div>
        The exact combination of breeds that Dobermann used to create his famous guard dog is not known, but there are some educated guesses. The old German Shepherd, an influence in so many European breeds of the period, offered intelligence, biddability, and stamina. The Rottweiler was one plausible source of the black-and-tan pattern that became inextricably linked with the Doberman, contributing strength and natural guarding ability. The German Pinscher - the latter word means “terrier” in German - likely added pluck and speed. And that all-around favorite hunting breed, the Weimaraner, may have provided the scenting ability that is so crucial in a working dog.
    </div>


    <div>
        When he first set out to create the breed that would posthumously be bestowed his name, Dobermann worked with two other local dog aficionados: fellow night watchman Herr Rebel and Herr Stegmann, who often journeyed to Switzerland with his butcher's dogs to purchase cattle. Together, they bred their first litters from dogs that reportedly were supposed to have been skinned.

    <div>
        One of those, presumably, was “Schnuppe,” a relatively smooth-coated, reportedly mouse-gray female. A surviving photograph from the 1870s depicts Schnuppe at Dobermann's feet - a small, vaguely terrier-sized creature who resembles no recognizable purebred we know today.
    </div>

    <div>
        But Dobermann, who never kept stud records, was not concerned with good looks; his overarching criterion was a dog with the guts and drive to stand up to anything that dared challenge it. In fact, some of Dobermann's early dogs may have had too much of a good thing, relentlessly chasing game and paying the price with a hunter's bullet.
