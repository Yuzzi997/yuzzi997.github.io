            <h1>About Ai Weiwei's Sunflower Seeds
            </h1>
            <p>Ai Weiwei initially conceived 'Sunflower Seeds' for his Unilever Series commission at Tate Modern's Turbine Hall, opening in October 2010. Ai Weiwei's take on the large hall was simple and complex, poetic and disturbing at the same time: He filled the Turbine Hall with a thick layer of sunflower seeds handcrafted in porcelain, a total of 100.000.000 seeds, with a total weight of 150 tons.</p>
            
            <p>Ai Weiwei began the process of producing the porcelain seeds two and a half year in advance of the Tate Modern exhibition – and earlier and smaller editions of seeds have been exhibited before the opening there. Also from the Tate installation Ai Weiwei has afterwards created new and smaller versions, why the original version of 150 tons is now 100 tons.</p>
            
            <p>
                Acclaimed as the “seeds of hope”, a work of “part prophecy, part threat”, an installation intriguingly “contemplative and barbed”, Ai Weiwei’s Sunflower Seeds has been exhibited in various versions at 12 galleries across 11 cities, 9 countries since 2009. As the institution hosting the inaugural exhibition of this work, Faurschou Foundation has had the honor to show 'Sunflower Seeds' three times in both its Beijing and Copenhagen spaces.
            </p>

            <p>
                A work composed of ”particles”, 'Sunflower Seeds' appears in ever-changing forms in exhibitions. It is the ”heap of grain” at Magasin 3, the grey ”beach” at Tate Modern and the ”carpet” at Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporáneo.  It reached its peak in terms of amount and weight at Tate Modern in 2010 - 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds, weighing 150 tons, covered the 1,000-square-metre floor to a depth of 10cm at the Turbine Hall. Sheena Wagstaff, chief curator from Tate Modern, commented that the work combined “an epic sense of scale with an exquisite level of craftsmanship”.

                It took more than 1,600 artisans in Jingdezhen (the town that once made the imperial porcelain for over a thousand years), two and a half years to manufacture this huge pile of ceramic husks out of the kaolin from local mountains. After a striking 30-step procedure, each seed, hand-painted and fired at 1,300 degrees, is unique and unpredictable. ”This is perhaps the most costly work among all artworks, both Chinese and Western,” Ai Weiwei said.
            </p>
            <p>
                The layers of seeds, though simple in form, embody multiple meanings. The sunflower seed is a common street snack in China, an everyday object from the artist’s childhood. It evokes the memory of hardships and hunger during the Cultural Revolution, and the era of socialist planned economy with the collective worship of the ”sun” - Chairman Mao.
            </p>

            <p>
                For Ai Weiwei, 'Sunflower Seeds' is one piece of art that is composed of 100 million pieces of art. As a singular tiny sculpture, every seed is submerged by a hundred million ones with subtle nuances, similar yet each unique, just as 1,600 workers in Jingdezhen performing repetitive duties; as 1.3 billion Chinese, silent in the crowd; as every fragmented individual in this digital era. Through a sunflower seed, Ai Weiwei triggers a Domino effect, enlarging the lengthy, complicated and exquisite process by 100 million times. Devoting unimaginable patience, time and energy, he brings into focus the significance of individuals, and the imposing strength when they gather together.
            </p>

            <p>
                Like Ai Weiwei’s other works, 'Sunflower Seeds' is a work closely related to the society, politics and economy in China, and also a project that can be accomplished only in this country. It alludes to the globalization and mass production in China that caters to western consumerism, and to the deemed insignificant element at the bottom of the production chain - thousands of cheap labors, assembly lines in gigantic factories, and tedious procedures. Absurdly, 'Sunflower Seeds' provided work for 1,600 artisans in Jingdenzhen, a fact that is an ironic reflection of the social reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Employing diverse media and techniques, as well as dexterity, wit and humor, Ai Weiwei has been creating ”social sculptures” rooted in contemporary Chinese society. In 'Sunflower Seeds', we can also get a glimpse of the relationship between the individual and the collective implied in 'Fairytale' (2007), the adapt inheritance of traditional techniques in 'Through' (2007-08), the symbolic and metaphoric appliance of materials in 'World Map' (2006), and his influential outspoken publicity through the social network. Ai’s deft transforming of local resources into a both poetic and provocative statement of contemporary art intelligently and audaciously subverts the tradition and encourages the reform. 'Sunflower Seeds' expresses Ai Weiwei’s responsibility as an artist, “Seeds grow...The crowd will have its way, eventually.”
